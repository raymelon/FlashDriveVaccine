## Overview
Using your pendrive especially on unsecured systems poses risk in getting the classic *shortcut virus* â€”
the culprit on hiding your precious files and folders embedded on your pendrive's root.

These are commonly resolved using `attrib` command, but there's a saying,
> ***An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.***
                
as most of us know.

### Prevention of infection is simple in four steps,
1. Cleaning and making the drive eligible by formatting it to NTFS
2. Making the root directory unwritable
   > *Preventing file/folder corruption as what shortcut viruses do on root directory files/folders*
3. Injecting fake (thus safe) shortcut virus files on drive's root directory
   > *As how vaccines inject dead/less harmful viruses to provide immunity*
3. Preventing modification on those fake viruses through NTFS Permissions

## GOO-ee Design
Since it targets legacy shortcut viruses, I themed it back to good old Visual Basic 6 days.
